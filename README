This repository contains linting tools for Khan Academy's codebase.

Most of the JavaScript linting code is based on Google's freely available and open-source Closure Linter:
http://code.google.com/closure/utilities/

It has been modified to suit Khan Academy's slightly different style guides and wrapper scripts have been created to be used as pre-commit hooks for Mercurial.


Usage
==========

First, install dependent packages via the requirements.txt file

$ pip install -r requirements.txt

Then you can automatically invoke lints on modified or added files in Mercurial.
Add to .hgrc to use:

[hooks]
pretxncommit.lint = /path/to/khanlint.py

If the project has a lint-blacklist.txt in the top level directory of the project, files listed there will be ignored in the linting process. This can be useful for legacy files.

If a forced commit is required, set the environment variable  FORCE_COMMIT to 1 prior to calling 'hg commit' (there doesn't  seem to be a way to pass args to a pretxncommit script otherwise)

If you would like to lint manually, invoke gjslint.py. You can try to also use fixjsstyle.py to automatically fix some style violations.
