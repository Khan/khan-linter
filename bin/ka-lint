# A script that calls the proper runlint.py for the repo you are
# currently in.
#
# For repos, such as webapp, that define their own ka-lint --
# either at the top level or in <top-level>/testing -- we run
# their ka-lint.  Otherwise we run runlint.py in khan-linter.
#
# Note that if you are in webapp-root, say, and run
#    ka-lint /tmp/whatever
# we will still use webapp's linter even though you are linting a file
# outside webapp.  There's no great way to do otherwise -- what do we do
# for
#   ka-lint webapp_file.py /tmp/whatever
# ?  Separate into separate ka-lint calls?  It's a mess.  And I
# don't expect people to do this outside-repo linting anyway, so I'm not
# going to worry about it for now.
