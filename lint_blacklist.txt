# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# AN EXAMPLE BLACKLIST FILE
# This file will be used when linting changes to files in this directory,
# but also provides an example of what blacklist files should look like,
# so it contains a few extra entries for illustration.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# All filenames are taken to be relative to the directory containing
# this file.
#
# NOTE: These entries are normal glob patterns, with the addition that
# '**' means 'any number of directories here' (including 0,
# so **/foo matches 'foo', 'a/foo', 'a/b/foo', etc.)

# Source control directories
.hg
.git

# Autogenerated code
**/compressed.js
**/hashed-*.js

# Third party code (trailing / is for human-readability that this is a dir)
closure_linter/
node_modules/
vendor/
six.py

# Other files
main.py
api/v1.py
